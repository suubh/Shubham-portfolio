It is a web app built using Ruby where we can write our article and there are features to edit,update and delete the articles.Also there is a feature for users to comment on others article and to prevent it from spammers there is an option to delete comments.It's structure is adopted from the [Ruby on Rails docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) but was designed by me and added some of the features like the root page and comments box .
